# BMplot: Base Modification Visulization

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package implements functions to visualize the profile of base
modification in both DNA and RNA.

## Introduction

Epigenetics plays an important role in Biology in the way of changing
genetic information without changing nucleic acids. Histone modification
and Methylation are two vital mechanisms in Epigenetics.

Many methods are used to detect the methylation in Epigenentics with the
combination of sequencing and chemical methods. `Me‑DIP` and `oxBS‑seq`
for `5mC`. `TAB-seq` and `hme‑DIP` for `5hmC`. `6mA‑DIP` and
`6mA‑RE-seq` for `6mA`. These methods can be divided into two
categories, including `Antibody enrichment techniques` for base
fragments and `Single-base resolution techniques` for single base.
BMplot is designed to visualize the `Single-base resolution techniques`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of BMplot from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("YuLab-SMU/BMplot")
```
